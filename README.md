NuclearCraft Heat Sink Balancing
=============================================


Summary
-------

A small program that will calculate the abundances of different heat sink types in a collection of overhaul fission reactor designs, weighted by the sink cooling rates. Simply place all of your design jsons from Hellrage's NC reactor planner v2.x into a 'designs' directory and run the program!

You'll need the planner config json, the 'designs' directory and the jar. If you are using Windows/MacOS, you may want the batch/command file to run the program.
